# polynomial-regression
In this repository we will see how polynomial regression works with the same insurance example.In this we use sgd
***(Stochastic Gradient Descent)*** method. we can also use the ols(Ordinary least squares) method, but both will give same results!!!

pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn

pip install seaborn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/polynomial-regression.git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd polynomial-regression
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python poly.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
